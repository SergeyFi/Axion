# Axion Voxel Game Engine

Welcome to **Axion**, a voxel game engine currently in the early stages of development. This project is primarily aimed at my personal learning and practice in game development.

## Development Goals

The main objectives of this project are:
- To deepen my understanding of graphics programming and game engine architecture.
- To experiment with various game development techniques and methodologies.
- To create a customizable and flexible engine that can be adapted for different types of games.
